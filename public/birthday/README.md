# Birthday media folder

Drop here:

- **Images** — jpg, png, etc. (for the polaroid collage)
- **Videos** — mp4, webm (will play muted in the collage)
- **Music** — one audio file for the Happy Birthday background music. Name it **music.mp3** and put it in this folder; the app will play it when she taps "Tap to see your gift".

The site will pick them up automatically. Reference paths in the app as `/birthday/filename` (e.g. `/birthday/photo.jpg`, `/birthday/music.mp3`).
