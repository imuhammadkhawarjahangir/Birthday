# Birthday media folder

Drop here:

- **Images** — jpg, png, etc. (for the polaroid collage)
- **Videos** — mp4, webm (will play muted in the collage)
- **Music** — one audio file for the Happy Birthday background music

The site will pick them up automatically. Reference paths in the app as `/birthday/filename` (e.g. `/birthday/photo.jpg`).
